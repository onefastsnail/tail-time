# T~~ai~~l time

A fun wee project to help create bedtime stories (tales) using [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and send those stories onwards to one's reading device.

A very much WIP project.

The current goal was not to make a public service out of this, but rather make something useful to my needs. I plan to make this into a usable service by publishing the generated stories for all to see, however until that time, this project can easily be forked and modified to fit your own needs.

## Background

I love reading to my kids. I love technology. I had a small window of opportunity one evening and an idea to mix these two together.

## Architecture 

This solution is the definition of :100: overkill, and could be done in far simpler ways, even in a single small script, but what would be the fun be in that!

## Development

Coming soon.

## Up next...

Many things but here is a few:

- Feed to the story back into OpenAI for validation and improvements
- Build a large story consisting of chapters covering various topics
- Architecture to allow the pipeline to be invoked by Alexa custom skill
