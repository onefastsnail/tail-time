# T~~ai~~l time

A service generating bedtime stories from OpenAI and sending those to an email.

A very much WIP project, with plenty of ideas to bring these stories alive.

## Background

I love reading to my kids. I love technology. I had a small window of opportunity and an idea to mix these two together by using OpenAI to help generate stories for my kids.

These stories would then be sent to my Kindle ahead of time for a nice reading experience.
