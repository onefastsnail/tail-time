# T~~ai~~l time

A wee project to help generate bedtime stories using OpenAI and then send those stories to an email.

A very much WIP project, with plenty of ideas to bring these stories alive. The current goal was not to make a service out of this, but rather make something useful to my needs. I may make this into a usable service, however, this project can easily be forked and modified to fit your own needs.

## Background

I love reading to my kids. I love technology. I had a small window of opportunity on evening and an idea to mix these two together by using OpenAI to help generate stories for my kids.

These stories would then be sent to my Kindle for a nice reading experience.

## Infra

This solution is the definition of overkill, and could be done in far simpler ways, even in a single small script, but where would the fun be in that!

## Development


## Up next...

- Build a story consisting of chapters
- Infra to allow Alexa to invoke with the topic as input
