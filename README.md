# T~~ai~~l time

A service generating bedtime stories from OpenAI and sending those to an email.

A very much WIP project, with plenty of ideas to bring these stories alive.

## Infra

This solution is very much overkill, and could be done in far simpler aways.

## Background

I love reading to my kids. I love technology. I had a small window of opportunity and an idea to mix these two together by using OpenAI to help generate stories for my kids.

These stories would then be sent to my Kindle ahead of time for a nice reading experience.

## Up next...

- Build a story consisting of chapters
- Infra to allow Alexa to invoke with the topic as input
